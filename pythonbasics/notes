# if __name__ == '__main__':: This is a conditional statement that checks if the script is being run as the main program. The __name__ variable is a built-in variable in Python that represents the name of the current module. When a script is run directly, the __name__ variable is set to '__main__'. This condition is often used to include code that should only be executed when the script is run directly, and not when it is imported as a module.
